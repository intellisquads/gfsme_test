                dd A claim is a demand to be compensated for an alleged injury.  You may encounter a situation where a patient is unhappy with an outcome.  This is not a claim until there is a demand for compensation or formal legal proceedings based on alleged medical negligence are initiated.

                dt What can I expect from your attorney?
                dd Initially, you will be contacted by an AllRisk attorney for an initial phone interview.  During this conference, you will be advised of the litigation process and a discussion of the specific facts of the insured’s matter will be entertained.

                dt When does info get reported to the (NPDB)?
                dd The information is reported to the NPDB only when the insurance carrier makes a payment on behalf of an insured. A situation could exist where there is a judgement against an insured and the insured chooses to pay the judgment himself or herself. In that case, no report is made to the NPDB.

                dt How can I obtain my Claims History?
                dd Requests for claims histories must be in writing and signed by the insured. The request should include the insured’s name, license number, policy number (if not insured under your own name), and the specific years for which the claims history is sought.
